# Demo extension in React

This is a demo project for [this blog post](http://rubberduck.io/blog/browser-extensions-react). At the end of the post, we will have a browser extension that is:

- Built on create-react-app, without [ejecting](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#npm-run-eject)
- Development mode with near-hot reloading on `npm start`
- Production builds with `npm run build`
